# Introduction

## Getting Started

Welcome to UniquID!

This tutorial will guide, step by step, your deployment of a new UniquID instance, followed by the connection of your IoT platform \(AWS IoT\) and the first devices.  
Our goal is to facilitate your understanding of the UniquID tools, providing a quick hands-on experience. Most of the code \(including this documentation\) is open-source, and we strongly encourage any ideas to improve it!

To begin, visit our [site](https://uniquid.com) and create a new account. Shortly after, you will receive a verification email: simply click the magic link in the email to complete your subscription and begin!

Once logged in, click the `Create Admin User` button from your console. This will download a `credentials.json` file.

Carefully store the credentials file for future use! You will need it during the next steps.
